# rlinf-robodojo-runtime

RoboDojo environment runtime for [RLinf](https://github.com/RLinf/RLinf) and
[RPent](https://github.com/RLinf/RPent).

RoboDojo (`RoboDojo-Benchmark/RoboDojo`) is an Isaac Sim benchmark for dual-arm
ARX-X5 manipulation. Its Python code is a source tree whose top-level
directories (`env/`, `src/`, `task/`, `utils/`) are meant to sit on
`PYTHONPATH`; its dependency set pins Isaac Sim, RoboDojo's IsaacLab fork and
cuRobo to versions that conflict with the agent stack of any framework that
drives it.

This distribution is the RoboTwin-pattern answer — compare
`rlinf-robotwin-runtime` — in two parts:

1. The validated RoboDojo tree is vendored under `robodojo_runtime/_source`, and
   `robodojo_runtime.source_root()` hands back the directory to put on
   `PYTHONPATH`. RoboDojo's own imports (`import env.global_configs`,
   `from src.collect_client.collect_env import ...`) are untouched.
2. The simulator pins live in this distribution's `dependencies`, so an
   integrator's environment extra only has to name this package.

## Use

```python
import os
from robodojo_runtime import assets_root, source_root

os.environ["ROBODOJO_SOURCE_ROOT"] = str(source_root())  # optional override
os.environ["ROBODOJO_ASSETS_ROOT"] = "/data/robodojo"   # where Assets/ lives
```

Or from a shell, with the runtime installed in the interpreter that runs the
environment server:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH="$(python -c 'from robodojo_runtime import source_root; print(source_root())'):$PYTHONPATH"
export ROBODOJO_ASSETS_ROOT=/data/robodojo
```

`ROBODOJO_SOURCE_ROOT` overrides the vendored tree, so a developer checkout can
be used without reinstalling.

## What is not shipped

* `Assets/**` — the robot, object, material and layout data. Download it from
  the RoboDojo dataset and point `ROBODOJO_ASSETS_ROOT` at the directory that
  contains `Assets/`.
* NVIDIA's USD/material asset pack referenced by IsaacLab; see RoboDojo's
  `utils/ensure_usd_path.py` and `ROBODOJO_USD_ASSET_PREFIX`.
* Policy checkpoints, in particular the Pi_05 release.
* `XPolicyLab` — a separate checkout with its own launcher.

## What the vendored tree contains

This is not a pristine copy of upstream RoboDojo. Upstream's public release is
eval-only: it has no steppable environment client, and the integration needs
two things it does not ship. `SOURCE_LOCK.txt` records both, file by file:

* **an environment patch** — cuRobo planner, robot/scene/seed managers, the eval
  client and one task. Without it the wrapped environment does not reproduce
  the behaviour the recipes were validated against.
* **a collection client** — `src/collect_client/` plus
  `src/eval_client/traj_recorder.py`: a steppable environment built on
  RoboDojo's own `ObsManager`/`SeedManager`, and the trajectory/video recorder
  the environment server uses.

Both are MIT-compatible derivative work of RoboDojo; they are published here
with provenance rather than silently folded into the upstream files.

## Vendored patch

The vendored articulation implementation includes upstream
[`0268168`](https://github.com/RoboDojo-Benchmark/RoboDojo/commit/0268168bb0ab3a51c296ca36290697a54f2f5b91)
([PR #30](https://github.com/RoboDojo-Benchmark/RoboDojo/pull/30)). This restores
captured USD joint drive targets after resetting joint positions in both
`apply_saved_pose()` and `relocate_offscreen()` when an object's metadata sets
`physics.reset_drive: true`. SpringButton assets use that flag; the original
August 7 vendored code ignored it. Objects without the flag keep their existing
reset behavior. The base upstream revision and simulator dependency pins stay
unchanged; `SOURCE_LOCK.txt` records this separate backport.

CPU regression tests use real USD stages and replace the simulator boundary:

```bash
uv run --no-project --python 3.11 --with pytest --with numpy --with pyyaml --with omegaconf --with usd-core python -m pytest tests -q
```

These tests verify USD target restoration, both reset paths, opt-out behavior
and removed joints/drives. They do not verify PhysX motion or button rebound.
The unmerged upstream
[PR #48](https://github.com/RoboDojo-Benchmark/RoboDojo/pull/48) addresses runtime
PhysX target synchronization separately and is not included in this backport.

`env/global_configs.py` gains two environment variables, both defaulting to
upstream behaviour:

* `ROBODOJO_ROOT` — code root (defaults to `<parent of env/>`, unchanged).
* `ROBODOJO_ASSETS_ROOT` — data root that contains `Assets/` (defaults to the
  code root, unchanged).

This is what lets the code live in an installed wheel while the multi-gigabyte
scene data lives on its own volume. The exact upstream commit and the patch are
recorded in `SOURCE_LOCK.txt`.

## Simulator bridge (0.3.0)

`robodojo_runtime.bridge.VectorEnv(task_config, n_envs, env_seeds)` provides
`reset(env_idx=None, env_seeds=...)`, `get_obs()`, `step(actions)`,
`check_seeds(seeds)`, and `close(clear_cache=True)`. Importing the bridge
does not import Isaac Sim; construction starts AppLauncher before loading the
vendored environment. The bridge reuses the collection client and the native
observation, robot, scene and reward managers.

Set `task_config.task_name` and optionally `env_cfg_type` (default
`arx_x5`), `source_root`, `save_dir`, `cuda_device`, `headless`,
`max_episode_steps`, and `random`. Official reset seeds are layout IDs;
random reset selects a saved template and generates a fresh scene seed,
matching the RPent random-layout path. Random mode requires saved templates.

Actions have shape `(N,H,A)`, or four joint-key arrays shaped
`(N,H,width)`. The key/state order is left arm, right arm, left gripper,
right gripper; `action_dims` defaults to `[6,6,1,1]`.
Observations include `full_image`, optional wrist images, flat `state`,
`instruction`, and native `vision` including intrinsic/extrinsic metadata.
Step returns observations, chunk-total rewards, latched termination/truncation
arrays of shape `(N,)`, and per-slot info dictionaries. It never auto-resets.

One slot runs on the caller's main thread. Multiple slots use spawned processes,
one Isaac application per slot, because native reset and physics affect the
whole scene. Protect application entry points with `if __name__ == "__main__"`.
Partial resets use a full, globally indexed seed list and leave other slots
untouched. Multi-slot operation has CPU contract coverage only; GPU throughput,
resource use, rollout behavior and task success remain unverified.

The bridge is outside `_source/`; the validated vendored tree is unchanged.
`assets_root()` defaults to the code root, or `ROBODOJO_ASSETS_ROOT` when
set, and always names the directory **containing** `Assets/`.
